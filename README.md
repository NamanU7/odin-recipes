# odin-recipes Project for basic HTML
I made this website wherien I implement basic html elements and make an
organized file structure for a website. I also practice using git and 
bash on the terminal. I can't wait to continue advancing and use css
for styling my hmtl websites and javascript for manipulating the DOM.
